## 1. ðŸ†š What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

- **Git** is a version control system. Think of it as a tool that tracks changes in your code, lets you go back in time, and helps you collaborate without messing things up. You run Git on your local machine (via terminal/command line).
  
- **GitHub** is a cloud platform that hosts your Git repositories online. It adds extra features like issues, pull requests, collaboration tools, and project boards. Basically, Git is the engine, and GitHub is the garage where everyone meets up to work on the car.
